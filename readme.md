# NOTICE
Magical Nights is now in-repo for Cataclysm BN! Due to issues regarding attribution raised in one attempt at in-repoing it (which were fixed in the sequel to that PR) as well as wanting to avoid anyone downloading an outdated version of the mod from here on out, I have elected to remove it from the repo and completely transition this repo into a space for Magical Nights **addons**, starting with Manic Magical Nights. If you really want to find an older version of the mod, you can look through the git history.
